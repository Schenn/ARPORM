Project: PDOI
Description:

As of 2011, mysql_functions() in php have begun
the process of being depreciated.  In the meantime
we get to use the fantastic PDO created to simplify
and secure the current system of database access and 
maintenance.  

This static class (and it's paired config object), serve as 
a simple way of interacting with and retrieving data from a 
database.

*****************************************

Currently, the PDOI only reliably interacts with MySQL database.  
Help contribute to the project and improve its versatility!
